# Test Implementation TODO List


Add a test handler, where we can setup gollm and run all the tests with that instance. Could be a single function that runs all the tests. Also can be run in batch mode, with multiple instances of gollm. This would become a higher abstraction layer, and we could run all the tests with a single function call.

## Implementation Guidelines
For each test:
1. Use the testing framework properly
2. Implement proper assertions
3. Add appropriate timeouts
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Add skip conditions for long-running tests
6. Set up proper test configurations
7. Document test purpose and requirements
